Usage example: python list_files.py /tmp/temp1/
Notes: did not handle case when no permissions to run the script, 
you will need to run chmod +x to script file if needed.

Generals: 
- Output is printed as 'tree' of files and directories 
- The code contains many comments to explain how all works, read it - it will help you undertand the code better
